# fhnw-ivis: Monetary influence in U.S. politics
Visualization of monetary influence in the U.S. congress for the FHNW course [ivis](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/studium/module/9018825?show_language=en).

## Summary
We want to show how companies and industries influenced politicians and parties over time by donating money. The focus is on the US congress (Senate & House). Companies either donate directly or indirectly via PACs (Political Action Committees). The goal is to have a compact overview of the two chambers (seating arrangement) and show who has received how much from where. Clicking on an individual shows a summary. The change of the political landscape should be visible by changing the timeline.
